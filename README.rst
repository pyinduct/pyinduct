This project provides a python toolbox for simulation and control design of infinite dimensional systems.

* Free software: GPL v3.0
* Documentation: https://pyinduct.readthedocs.org.

Features
--------

* easy simulation of underlying systems using ready-to-go FEM implementations or custom modal approximations
* predefined eigenfunctions for parabolic problems up to 2nd order
* automated controller approximation based on individual shape-functions
* powerful visualization methods for verification
